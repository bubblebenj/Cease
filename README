Consistent Elemental Attributes Setup Engine.
Setup your webpage layout using consistent css like attributes with more control over placement and size.
Cease philisophy is close to to [Android ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout).

NO HACKS to place objects where you want, instead cease gives you more controls by using : pivot, size, position and a referent element.
exemple : "ref : parent; pivot : left bottom; position : right bottom; size : 10px 50%;".

ref value must match [parent|prev|next|document|window|any_valid_css_selector] and must match a single element (jQ.size() == 1).
x must match [left|center|right|any_decimal_number_with_a_valid_unit].
y must match [top|center|bottom|any_decimal_number_with_a_valid_unit].
Valid_units must match [%|px] : no value means a ratio like 0.5 = 50%.

The project is written in haXe, targets javascript and is based on jQuery.
